I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen’s University, where I work on different research projects funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and Mitacs, as well as private sector. I received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. (first class honors) degrees in Computer Engineering in 2007 and 2010, respectively. From 2011 to 2015, I was with the Shamsipour Technical University, Tehran, Iran, as a lecturer. In 2015, I joined Instituto Superior Técnico, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal, where I completed my Ph.D. degree with distinction and honour in Electrical and Computer Engineering in January, 2019. My main research interests are machine learning and deep learning for biometrics, forensics, affective computing, and computer vision. I have contributed more than 40 papers in notable conferences and journals in my area and have been a reviewer for multiple top-tier conferences and journals in the field.
